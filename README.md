# FOOD_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM
🍴 Food Recommendation System
This project is a content-based food recommendation system designed to help users discover dishes similar to the ones they enjoy. Built using Python and an interactive Streamlit interface, the system leverages machine learning techniques to deliver intelligent and personalized food suggestions.

🧠 How It Works
The system uses TF-IDF vectorization to analyze the textual features of food items and applies cosine similarity to identify and recommend dishes that are closely related in content. When a user enters the name of a dish, the system returns a list of similar food items based on their textual relevance and context within the dataset.

💡 Key Features
Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests dishes based on the input dish name by analyzing textual similarities.

Streamlit Web Interface: A lightweight and responsive web application allowing users to interact easily with the system.

Pre-Trained Model: The recommendation engine uses pre-computed similarity scores for faster and more efficient results.

Simple and Scalable: Designed to be easily extendable with additional data or features such as cuisine type, ingredients, or user preferences.

📂 Project Overview
The project includes:

A cleaned food dataset containing various dish names and metadata.

A machine learning model trained to calculate similarity between dishes.

A user-friendly frontend interface to input a food item and view suggestions instantly.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python for backend logic and data processing

pandas for handling and analyzing the dataset

scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity modeling

Streamlit for building the interactive user interface

🌱 Potential Enhancements
Incorporate user dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)

Add filters based on nutrition (calories, protein, carbs, etc.)

Enable image-based food recognition using deep learning

Collect real-time user feedback to improve the recommendation quality

Deploy the app for public access via cloud platforms
